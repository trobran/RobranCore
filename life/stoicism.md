    1. Emotional control - the ability to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively
        - emotional control is not about suppressing or ignoring you emotions
        - it's about understanding and managing them 
        - recognizing your feelings but not allowing them to dictate your actions
        - You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength -- Marcus Aurelius
        - You can't always control what happens to you but you can control how your respond
